# 🧙‍♂️ One Ring to Tune Them All - Getting Started

Welcome to the One Ring AI Fine-Tuning Platform! This guide will help you set up and start using the platform to fine-tune language models with your custom data.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/one-ring-to-tune-them-all.git
   cd one-ring-to-tune-them-all
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Unix/macOS
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # For document processing (optional)
   pip install -r requirements-docs.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) Install additional dependencies for your specific hardware:
   ```bash
   # For CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs)
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
   
   # For ROCm (AMD GPUs)
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.4.2
   ```

## 🖥️ Starting the Web Interface

To launch the web interface, run:

```bash
python -m one_ring serve
```

This will start the Gradio web interface, which you can access in your browser at `http://localhost:7860`.

## 🛠️ Command Line Interface

The platform provides a command-line interface for various tasks:

### Train a Model

```bash
python -m one_ring train --config path/to/config.json
```

### Process Documents

```bash
python -m one_ring.utils.document_processor /path/to/documents --output-dir /path/to/output
```
